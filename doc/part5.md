# onedraw — a GPU-driven 2D renderer

## Stats


## Next steps

If time permits, we'd like to work on these topics in the near future

* custom font support
* filtering support for textured quad
* texture format support for the texture array
* ~~a new approach to render quadratic bezier curves without 3 degrees sdf~~
* clip with shapes : disc, ellipse, etc... can be useful for worldmap miniature and won't cost that much
* gradient (two-colors solid), radial gradient, vertical/horizontal gradient
